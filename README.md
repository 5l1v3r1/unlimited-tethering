# Unlimited Tethering

Bypass tethering caps or throttling on cell phone unlimited data plans. Potentially cancel your internet and route your whole home though your unlimited data plan.

## Requirements

* **Unlimited data plan**
* **Ability to hotspot your phone**
* **Computor or Router**

This is not a carrier specific method, I use Verizon but this should generally work with any carrier. It also doesn't matter if they throttle or cap you at 15GB or something, that is what we are about to work around.

If you are going to go the router method it will be a lot more work but the router will handle all the traffic routing and you can just connect any device in your house to your router and it will just work. If you are just going to use your PC then you can generally have this running in ~15 to 30 minutes.

I have personally used anywhere from 80-150GB of data with this method consistantly for 6+ months and never been throttled one time while my traffic was going through the tunnel.
